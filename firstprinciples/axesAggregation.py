# Given a stockâ€™s price history as a sequence, and
# assuming that you are only allowed to make one purchase and one sale, 
# what is the maximum profit that can be obtained?
# For example, given prices = (20, 18, 14, 17, 20, 21, 15), 
# the max profit would be 7, from buying at 14 and selling at 21.
